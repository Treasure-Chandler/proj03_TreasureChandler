* Project 3: At the ATM Machine
*
* Description:
* The purpose of this class is to implement a computer
* model for bank account transactinons at an ATM machine.
* This following functions this class will program is
* to open a new account, use an existing account that is
* previously opened, and abort the process.

/*
 * The ATM class represents the ATM machine. It communicates to
 * the user when a transaction is carried out. In order to execute
 * the transactions, the class must have access to the Account
 * class methods
